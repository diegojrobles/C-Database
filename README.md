# C-Database
My name is Diego and welcome to my first github project.

Learning from the repository "Build Your Own X", I was able to program a small and simple SQLite databse.
This is a big step in my programming journey, and I will be updating and improving upon the program as I gain experience.

Instructions:
Insert Command - insert # name person@email.com
View Inputs - select
Exit Program - .exit
